# Sunlu-V2_Filament_Dryer_Upgrade
 Upgraded the Sunlu PCB and Firmware.

I had to redesign the cover on the orginal design, and cut a hole for the inductor which didn't fit in the original enclosure. I used the wrong JST connectors, so I had to cut a hole for those as well, but that can be avoided with horizontal connectors instead of vertical. I provided all the design files and Code. The PCB, Schematic, and cover were designed inside Fusion 360. I used a generic OLED display, which I got off of amazon, link below. Most other components can be found in the BOD.csv.
